# Education Choropleth Map

A D3.js choropleth map of the US that presents each county's percentage of adults who are college graduates.

Inspired by the [Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map) as part of the curriculum for the [Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
